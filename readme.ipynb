    "# EOAS 5004: Earth System Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains tools and Jupyter notebooks for the course _EOAS 5004: Earth System Modeling_ taught in [Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python package for process-oriented climate modeling [climlab](https://github.com/climlab/climlab) by Brian E. J. Rose at University at Albany is used in this course. Course materials are adapted from [The Climate Laboratory](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4265097) by Brian E. J. Rose.\n",

    "## Set up the environment on JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using [The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) here. The TLJH is installed on our own server in the directory `/opt/tljh`. Admin access is required to install the environment for all users. But users can also install a local environment for themselves in a similar way (without using `sudo -E`). \n",

    "### Create a new Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal from the JupyterHub and create a Python environment `eoas5004` from the file `environment.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo -E conda env create --file environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new Python environemnt at `/opt/tljh/user/envs/eoas5004` with all the necessary packages we need. These packages are listed in the environment file `environment.yml`, which can be generated by the following command from an existing environment installed manually by `conda install`.\n",

    "Create a new Jupyter kernel from the Python environment `eoas5004` with a display name of \"EOAS 5004\".\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "This creates a local kernel at `$HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/eoas5004`. To share this kernel with all users on JupyterHub, move this kernel to `/opt/tljh/user/share/jupyter/kernels/`.\n",
